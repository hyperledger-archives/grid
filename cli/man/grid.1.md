**grid** â€” Command-line interface for Grid

SYNOPSIS
========

**grid** \[**FLAGS**\] \[**OPTIONS**\] \[**SUBCOMMAND**\]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `grid` utility is the command-line interface for Grid.

* Run `grid --help` to see the list of subcommands.

* Run `grid *SUBCOMMAND* --help` to see information about a specific
  subcommand (for example, `grid location create --help`).

* To view the man page for a Grid subcommand, use the "dashed form" of the
  name, where each space is replaced with a hyphen. For example, run
  `man grid-location-create` to see the man page for `grid location create`.
