          architecture guide

      description: |
        This endpoint can be used to submit batches to the underlying
        distributed ledger. The operation called by this endpoint will depend on
        which distributed ledger is supporting this deployment of Grid.
        Regardless of the underlying ledger, the body of this request must be a
        valid list of Sabre batches.

        If the Grid Daemon is running against a Sawtooth distributed ledger,
        then the batches are forwarded to the `/batches` endpoint of the
        Sawtooth REST API.

        If the Grid Daemon is running against Splinter, then the `service_id`
        query parameter is required for this request. The Grid Daemon will use
        the service ID to forward the transaction to an endpoint on the Splinter
        Daemon for the Scabbard service corresponding to the provided service
        ID.

        The API will return immediately with a status of `202`. There will be
        no `data` object, only a `link` to a `/batch_statuses` endpoint to be
        polled to check the status of submitted batches.
      operationId: post_batches
      parameters:
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/service_id"

            The batch list was submitted for validation but have not yet been
            evaluated. After the server receives the batches for validation, it
            will attempt to execute the transactions contained in each batch in
            the batch list. If each of the transactions in a batch are
            successful, the distributed ledger's state will be updated and Grid
            will receive state delta events from the distributed ledger. The
            Grid Daemon processes these events and updates the Grid database
            accordingly.

            This means that there is a delay between when transactions are
            submitted and when the new data is actually available to fetch using
            the Grid REST API GET endpoints. This delay can range from a few
            milliseconds to several minutes depending on the underlying ledger.
            Developers should take this delay into account when designing apps
            on top of Grid.

      summary: Fetches the committed statuses for a set of batches
      description: |
        Fetches an array of objects with a status and id for each batch
        requested. There are four possible statuses with string values
        `'COMMITTED'`, `'INVALID'`, `'PENDING'`, and `'UNKNOWN'`.

        The batch(es) you want to check can be specified using the `id` filter
        parameter. If a `wait` time is specified in the URL, the API will wait
        to respond until all batches are committed, or the time in seconds has
        elapsed. If the value of `wait` is not set (i.e., `?wait&id=...`), or
        it is set to any non-integer value other than `false`, the wait time
        will be just under the API's specified timeout (usually 300).

        Note that because this route does not return full resources, the
        response will not be paginated, and there will be no `head` or
        `paging` properties.

        The Grid Daemon REST API could not understand the request due to invalid
        syntax. Normally this will indicate an invalid query parameter or a
        malformed payload.

    404NotFound:

        The requested resource did not exist. This can either mean that the

    500ServerError:
      description: |
        Something went wrong within the Grid Daemon. This normally is not
        something that the user has control over. If this type of error occurs,
        the message returned by the REST API may be generic. The server admin
        may have to look through the Grid Daemon service's logs to determine
        the cause of the server error.
